    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm NatKingCoder and I am a programmer! Outside of programming, I have 
      a wide variety of other things I like to do! As a programmer, I know quite
      a few languages, including: Scratch, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ProcessingJS, BASH, and SQL. Most of 
    these can be found on this site :)</p>

    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>I began programming in 2018, for a class in school. My first language was 
    Scratch. I immediately fell in love with programming. Since then, programming
    has become one of my major hobbies!</p>

    <h2>Other Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Outside of programming, I really enjoy cooking, camping, and gaming.
    Most of all, however, I really enjoy music. I play the double bass, and really
    enjoy it!</p>
